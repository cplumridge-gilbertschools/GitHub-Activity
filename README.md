# GitHub-Activity
*Welcome to the Standard 14 Activity Repository!*

In order to prepare for the Technical Skills Assessment <sup>(TSA)</sup>, we will be performing a few actions together.

**We will be debugging a Java program using the following steps:**
- Create a new branch from the main branch of the repo
- Commit changes to your branch
- Create a pull request, and discuss the changes with classmates
- When everyone has verified the changes, the commits will be merged into the main branch
